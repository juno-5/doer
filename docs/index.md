# Doer documentation overview

Welcome! This is the documentation site for running [Doer organized team
chat](https://zulip.com) in production, contributing to the [Doer open-source
project](https://github.com/doer), and generally learning how Doer works under
the hood.

The following pages may help you get started:

- [Installation instructions](production/install.md) for setting up your Doer
  server.
- [Contributing guide](contributing/contributing.md), with step-by-step
  instructions on how to get started contributing code to Doer.

You may also want to check out:

- [An overview](https://zulip.com/features/) of the features available in Doer.
- [Help center documentation](https://zulip.com/help/) for users and
  administrators of Doer organizations.
- [API documentation](https://zulip.com/api/) for writing integrations or bots
  using the Doer API.

If there's any information you can't find, please drop by the
[#documentation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/19-documentation)
channel in the [Doer development
community](https://zulip.com/development-community/) and let us know! We work
hard to make Doer's documentation comprehensive and easy to follow.
