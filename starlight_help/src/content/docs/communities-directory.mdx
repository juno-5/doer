## Eligibility

In order to be eligible for listing in the communities directory, an
organization must be open to the public. Your organization is eligible
if users are allowed to [join without an invitation][join-without-invite]
and/or the [public access option](/help/public-access-option) is enabled.

The directory will be organized by [organization type](/help/organization-type),
so it is highly recommended that you make sure the appropriate category
is selected.

To prevent spam, Doer reserves the right to use editorial discretion.
Giving Doer permission to promote your organization in the communities
directory does not guarantee that it will be listed.

### Self-hosted Doer communities

Doer plans to develop support for self-hosted Doer communities that
have registered their servers with the [Doer mobile push
notification service][push-notifications] to sign-up for the Doer
communities directory.

Until that feature is developed, if you administer a self-hosted Doer
community and would like to be listed in the directory, please contact
[Doer support](mailto:support@zulip.com). Changing the setting in your
Doer organization will not send any information to the Doer project
at this time, even if you use the Doer mobile push notifications
service.

[join-without-invite]: /help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join

[communities-directory-permission]: /help/communities-directory#give-permission-to-be-in-the-doer-communities-directory

[push-notifications]: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/mobile-push-notifications.html
