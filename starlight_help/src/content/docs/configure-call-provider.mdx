By default, Doer integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. Organization administrators can also
change the organization's call provider. The call providers
supported by Doer are:

* [Jitsi Meet](/integrations/jitsi)
* [Zoom integration](/integrations/zoom)
* [BigBlueButton integration](/integrations/big-blue-button)
* [Constructor Groups integration](/integrations/constructor-groups)

<DoerTip>
  You can disable the video and voice call buttons for your organization
  by setting the **call provider** to "None".

## Configure your organization's call provider

## Use a self-hosted instance of Jitsi Meet

Doer uses the [cloud version of Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)
as its default call provider. You can also use a self-hosted
instance of Jitsi Meet.
