Integrations let you connect Doer with other products. For example, you can get
notification messages in Doer when an issue in your tracker is updated, or for
alerts from your monitoring tool.

Doer offers [over 120 native integrations](/integrations/), which take
advantage of Doer's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) to organize
notification messages. Additionally, thousands of integrations are available
through [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/search).
You can also [connect any webhook designed to work with
Slack](/integrations/slack_incoming) to Doer.

If you don't find an integration you need, you can:

* [Write your own integration](#write-your-own-integration). You can [submit a
  pull
  request](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/reviewable-prs.html)
  to get your integration merged into the main Doer repository.
* [File an issue](https://github.com/doer/doer/issues/new/choose) to request
  an integration (if it's a nice-to-have).
* [Contact Doer Sales](mailto:sales@zulip.com) to inquire about a custom
  development contract.

## Set up an integration

### Native integrations

<Steps>
  1. [Search Doer's integrations](/integrations/) for the product you'd like to
     connect to Doer.
  1. Click on the card for the product, and follow the instructions on the page.
</Steps>

### Integrate via Zapier or IFTTT

If you don't see a native Doer integration, you can access thousands of
additional integrations through [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps) and
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/search).

<Steps>
  1. Search [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/search)
     for the product you'd like to connect to Doer.
  1. Follow the integration instructions for [Zapier](/integrations/zapier) or
     [IFTTT](/integrations/ifttt).
</Steps>

### Integrate via Slack-compatible webhook API

Doer can process incoming webhook messages written to work with [Slack's
webhook API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). This makes it easy to
quickly move your integrations when [migrating your
organization](/help/import-from-slack) from Slack to Doer, or integrate any
product that has a Slack webhook integration with Doer .

<DoerNote>
  **Note:** In the long term, the recommended approach is to use
  Doer's native integrations, which take advantage of Doer's topics.
  There may also be some quirks when Slack's formatting system is
  translated into Doer's.
</DoerNote>

<Steps>
  1. [Create a bot](/help/add-a-bot-or-integration) for the Slack-compatible
     webhook. Make sure that you select **Incoming webhook** as the **Bot type**.
  1. Decide where to send Slack-compatible webhook notifications, and [generate
     the integration URL](/help/generate-integration-url).
  1. Use the generated URL anywhere you would use a Slack webhook.
</Steps>

### Integrate via email

If the product you'd like to integrate can send email notifications, you can
[send those emails to a Doer channel](/help/message-a-channel-by-email). The
email subject will become the Doer topic, and the email body will become the
Doer message.

For example, you can configure your personal GitHub notifications to go to a
Doer channel rather than your email inbox. Notifications for each issue or pull
request will be grouped into a single topic.

## Write your own integration

You can write your own Doer integrations using the well-documented APIs below.
For example, if your company develops software, you can create a custom
integration to connect your product to Doer.

If you need help, best-effort community support is available in the [Doer
development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/). To inquire
about options for custom development, [contact Doer
Sales](mailto:sales@zulip.com).

### Sending content into Doer

* If the third-party service supports outgoing webhooks, you likely want to
  build an [incoming webhook
  integration](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks/incoming-webhooks-overview.html).
* If it doesn't, you may want to write a
  [script or plugin integration](/help/non-webhook-integrations).
* The [`doer-send` tool](/api/send-message) makes it easy to send Doer
  messages from shell scripts.
* Finally, you can
  [send messages using Doer's API](/api/send-message), with bindings for
  Python, JavaScript and [other languages](/api/client-libraries).

### Sending and receiving content

* To react to activity inside Doer, look at Doer's
  [Python framework for interactive bots](/help/running-bots) or
  [Doer's real-time events API](/api/get-events).
* If what you want isn't covered by the above, check out the full
  [REST API](/api/rest). The web, mobile, desktop, and terminal apps are
  built on top of this API, so it can do anything a human user can do. Most
  but not all of the endpoints are documented on this site; if you need
  something that isn't there check out Doer's
  [REST endpoints](https://github.com/doer/doer/blob/main/zproject/urls.py).
