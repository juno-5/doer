You can link to your Doer organization from the web with a Doer
[shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) badge:

[![Doer chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/doer-join_chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://chat.zulip.org)

Good places for the badge include your project's landing page, support
pages, and/or GitHub homepage.

To embed a Doer badge, copy and paste the following, replacing
`https://chat.zulip.org` with the URL of your Doer organization:

Markdown

```md "chat.zulip.org"
[![project chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/doer-join_chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://chat.zulip.org)
```

HTML

```html "chat.zulip.org"
<a href="https://chat.zulip.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/doer-join_chat-brightgreen.svg" /></a>
```
