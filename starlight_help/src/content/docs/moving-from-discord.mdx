The following steps are described in more detail below:

<Steps>
  1. [Create your organization](#create-your-organization).
  1. [Sign up for a plan](#sign-up-for-a-plan).
  1. [Configure your organization](#configure-your-organization).
  1. [Review and update communication
     policies](#review-and-update-communication-policies).
  1. [Prepare users for the transition](#prepare-users-for-the-transition).
  1. [Invite users to join](#invite-users-to-join).
</Steps>

Each organization is unique, but we hope these common practices will help you
think through the transition process in your own context.

## Create your organization

<CreateOrgNoImport />

## Sign up for a plan

<SignUpForAPlan />

## Configure your organization

<Steps>
  1. [Create your organization profile](/help/create-your-organization-profile),
     which is displayed on your organization's registration and login pages.
  1. [Create user groups](/help/create-user-groups) corresponding to roles in
     your Discord.
  1. Review [organization permissions](/help/manage-permissions), such as who
     can invite users, create channels, etc. Use groups to recreate role-based
     permissions.
  1. If your organization uses an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub, Salesforce,
     Zendesk, Jira, etc.), configure [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to
     automatically turn issue numbers (e.g., #2468) into links.
  1. Set up [custom profile fields](/help/custom-profile-fields), which make it
     easy for users to share information, such as their pronouns, job title, or
     team.
  1. Review [default user settings](/help/configure-default-new-user-settings),
     including language, [default visibility for email
     addresses](/help/configure-email-visibility), and notification preferences.
  1. [Create channels](/help/create-channels). Doer's
     [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) give each conversation its own
     space, so you likely need fewer channels than in Discord.
  1. To recreate your Discord bots in Doer, check out Doer's [native
     integrations](/integrations), and the [guide](/help/writing-bots) on writing
     your own interactive bots.
</Steps>

## Review and update communication policies

<CommunicationPoliciesIntro />

<FlattenedList>
  <CommunicationPoliciesList />

  * If you've been maintaining a forum in addition to your Discord server, it's
    common to discontinue it when moving to Doer. Conversations in Doer are
    organized enough to fulfill the role of a forum, and can be
    [configured](/help/public-access-option) for public access if desired.
  * Doer makes it easy to find conversations and follow up, so you may be able to
    reduce your reliance on @-mentions. [Silent
    mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user) make it easy
    to refer to someone without calling for their attention.
  * Because in Doer messages are organized by topic, it’ll generally be clear
    what you’re responding to when you send a message. Consider encouraging users
    to simply send messages to the appropriate topic, rather than
    [replying](/help/replying-to-messages) as in Discord.
  * If moving a community, be sure to check out Doer's [community moderation
    toolkit](/help/moderating-open-organizations).

## Prepare users for the transition

Prepare an introduction to Doer for your organization. It often works well to
combine a written announcement with a live presentation. Recommended topics to
cover include:
