  Check out the dedicated guides for moving to Doer from
  [Slack](/help/moving-from-slack), [Microsoft Teams](/help/moving-from-teams),
  [Discord](/help/moving-from-discord), and

The following steps are described in more detail below:

<Steps>
  1. [Create your organization](#create-your-organization).
  1. [Sign up for a plan](#sign-up-for-a-plan).
  1. [Configure your organization](#configure-your-organization).
  1. [Review and update communication policies](#review-and-update-communication-policies).
  1. [Prepare users for the transition](#prepare-users-for-the-transition).
  1. [Invite users to join](#invite-users-to-join).
</Steps>

Each organization is unique, but we hope these common practices will help you
think through the transition process in your own context.

## Create your organization

You can create a new Doer Cloud organization in less than two minutes. Setting
up a self-hosted server will take a bit longer, but is easy to do with Doer's
[robust
installer](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).

Doer has import tools for [Slack](/help/import-from-slack),
[Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost) and
[Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat). You can import your organization's
chat data, including message history, users, channels, and custom emoji. To
inquire about importing data from another product, [contact Doer
support](/help/contact-support).

Data is imported into Doer as a new organization, so the best time to import is
when your team is about to start using Doer for day-to-day work. This may be
part of your evaluation process, or after you've made the decision to move to
Doer.

    <Steps>
      1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Doer
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You
         can self-host Doer directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
         [Docker](https://github.com/doer/docker-doer), or with prebuilt images for
         [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/doer) and
         [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-doer).
      1. Create a Doer organization [on Doer Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or [on
         your self-hosted
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-3-create-a-doer-organization-and-log-in).

      1. To import data, follow the steps in the detailed import guides:
         * [Import from Slack](/help/import-from-slack)
         * [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
         * [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

## Sign up for a plan

## Configure your organization

<FlattenedSteps>
  <ConfigureYourOrganization />

  1. [Create channels](/help/create-channels), unless you've imported
     channels from another app. Doer's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics)
     give each conversation its own space, so one channel per team should be
     enough to get you started.
  1. Set up [integrations](/help/integrations-overview) so that your
     team can experience all their regular workflows inside the Doer app.

combine a written announcement with a live presentation. Recommended topics to
cover include:
