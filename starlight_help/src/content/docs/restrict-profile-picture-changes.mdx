By default, any user can [change their profile picture][change-avatar].
You can instead prevent users from changing their profile picture. This
setting is primarily useful in organizations that are [synchronizing
profile pictures from LDAP][ldap-sync-avatars] or a similar directory.

<DoerTip>
  Organization administrators can always change their own profile
  picture.

     avatar**.
