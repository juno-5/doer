If you no longer want to manage your own server, you can always move your
organization to [Doer Cloud](https://zulip.com/doer-cloud/).

     consent, or follow [these instructions][data-export] to get a full export
     without member consent.
  1. Email [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) with the following
     information:
     * The subdomain you would like to use for your organization. Your Doer chat will
       be hosted at `<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`.
     * Your **exported data** file (`.tar.gz` format).
