Welcome to Doer! This page will guide you through setting everything
up for [teaching with Doer](https://zulip.com/for/education/). If you
are using Doer for a different purpose, we recommend checking out the
[moving to Doer](/help/moving-to-doer) guide instead.

If you are a student, or if your Doer organization is already set up,
you can proceed to the [Using Doer for a
class](/help/using-doer-for-a-class) guide.

If you encounter any problems as you're getting started, please drop
by our [friendly development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/)
and let us know!

## Trying out Doer

You can start by reading about [Doer for Education](https://zulip.com/for/education/),
and how Doer can become the communication hub for your class. Doer
is the only [modern team chat app](https://zulip.com/features/) that is
[ideal](https://zulip.com/why-doer/) for both live and asynchronous
conversations. Post lecture notes and announcements, answer students’
questions, and coordinate with teaching staff all in one place.

We also highly recommend trying Doer for yourself! You can:

* [Create a Doer Cloud organization](https://zulip.com/new/) for free
  with just a few clicks.
* [Join the Doer development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/)
  to see Doer in action. Feel free to introduce yourself and ask questions!

## Choosing between Doer Cloud and self-hosting

Follow the [guide](/help/doer-cloud-or-self-hosting) on choosing between Doer
Cloud and self-hosting to pick the best option for you. If your needs change,
you can always [move to a self-hosted installation](/help/cloud-to-self-hosting)
or [to Doer Cloud](/help/move-to-doer-cloud).

Anyone can [start with Doer Cloud Free](https://zulip.com/new/), which works
well for a typical class. For large classes and departments, we offer [special
Doer for Education pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing),
with the same features as Doer Cloud Standard. You can always get started with
Doer Cloud Free, and upgrade down the line if needed.

## Do I need a separate Doer organization for each class?

There are a few ways to set up Doer, and different ones may be convenient for your needs:

* If your **school or department already has a Doer organization**,
  you will probably find it easiest to just add your class to
  it. Advantages:
  * Students and staff can use a single Doer account for all classes.
  * You can create department-wide channels, e.g., for announcing talks or other events.
  * You don’t need to set up a separate server if you’re self-hosting Doer.
* You can **set up a separate Doer organization for each class**
  you’re teaching. Advantages:
  * This makes it simple to manage permissions, e.g., if you want to
    make sure TAs from one class cannot moderate discussion from a
    different class.
  * Students can’t see who is in channels for other classes.
  * You can easily switch between multiple Doer organizations in
    the [Doer desktop apps](/apps/).
* You can **use a single Doer organization for several classes**
  you’re teaching, perhaps re-purposing a Doer organization from a
  prior term. Advantages:
  * Information from your classes is all in one place, e.g., if you
    want to re-post a response to a question that was also asked
    last time you taught the class.

If you change your mind down the line, you can rename your Doer
organization by sending a request to
[support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com).

## Create your organization profile

The information in your organization profile is displayed on the
registration and login page for your organization, and in the Doer app.

### Edit organization profile

<EditOrganizationProfile />

### Add a wide logo

<AddAWideLogo />

## Customize organization settings

<ReviewOrganizationSettingsInstructions />

A few settings to highlight:

* If your class uses a programming language, set the [default
  language for code blocks][default-code-block-language]. Also
  consider setting up [code playgrounds][code-playgrounds].
* If your class uses code repositories, [set up
  linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to make it easy to link to
  issues (e.g., just by typing #1234 for issue 1234).
* [Add custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji) that your class will enjoy.

[default-code-block-language]: /help/code-blocks#default-code-block-language

[code-playgrounds]: /help/code-blocks#code-playgrounds

### Roles and permissions

Doer offers [several levels of permissions based on user
roles](/help/user-roles). Here are some recommendations for
how to assign roles and permissions for a class.

#### Recommended roles and permissions for a single-class Doer organization

| Who                                 | Role                                           |

## Create channels

<CreateChannelsIntro />

### How to create a channel

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="relative/channel/all" />

  1. Click **Create channel** on the right.
  1. Fill out the requested info, and click **Create**.
</FlattenedSteps>

### Tips for creating channels

For most classes, the following channels are recommended:

* **#announcements**: For general announcements about the class. When
  creating this channel, [restrict posting
  permissions](/help/channel-posting-policy) so that only course staff
  ([administrators and moderators](/help/user-roles)) are
  allowed to post.
* **#staff (private)**: For discussions among course staff.
* **#general**: For random topics, e.g., students forming study groups.
* A channel for each **lecture** or **unit**, e.g., “Lecture 1: Course
  intro” or “Unit 3: Sorting algorithms”.
* A channel for each **section**/**tutorial group** (e.g., “Section 1”)

<DoerTip>
  You can start by creating channels for just the first few
  lectures/units at this point. When you create a new channel,
  you will be able to copy channel membership from existing channels.
</DoerTip>

A few notes:

* Small classes may need just one discussion channel for all lectures.
* If you are [using a single Doer organization][separate-orgs] for
  more than one class, all channel names should be prefixed with the
  name of the class, e.g., “CS101 > Lecture 1: Course intro”.

[separate-orgs]: /help/setting-up-doer-for-a-class#do-i-need-a-separate-doer-organization-for-each-class

## Customize settings for new users

<CustomizeSettingsForNewUsers />

<DoerTip>
  If using your Doer organization for a single class, set default
  channels for new users to include **#announcements**, **#general**,
  and all lecture/unit channels.
</DoerTip>

## Invite users to join

<DoerTip>
  Before inviting users, you may want to [delete any test
  messages][delete-message] or [topics](/help/delete-a-topic).
</DoerTip>

[delete-message]: /help/delete-a-message#delete-a-message-completely

### How to invite users to join

To simplify subscription management, be sure to set the channels
students and staff should be subscribed to when you create the
invitations. You may choose to send invitations to course staff
separately, so that they can immediately be subscribed to private
channels for your class.

</Tabs>

To get everyone off to a good start, you may wish to share the guide
to [Getting started with Doer][getting-started] and the guide to
[Using Doer for a class](/help/using-doer-for-a-class).

<DoerTip>
  If you create new channels later on, you can subscribe users
  [by group][create-user-groups] or copy membership from another
  channel (e.g., from Lecture 5 to Lecture 6).
</DoerTip>

[create-user-groups]: /help/setting-up-doer-for-a-class#create-user-groups

## Create user groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group)
multiple users at once,
[notifying](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) them about a
message. For example, you may find it useful to set up the following
user groups:

* @staff
* @TAs
* @graders
* @students
* @section1, @section2, etc.

### How to create a user group

## Set up integrations

Doer integrates directly with dozens of products, and with hundreds
more through [Zapier](/integrations/zapier) and
[IFTTT](/integrations/ifttt).  Popular Doer integrations include
[GitHub](/integrations/github) and
[GitLab](/integrations/gitlab). The [integrations
page](/integrations/) has instructions for integrating with each
product.

## Cleaning up at the end of a class

If you plan to use the same Doer organization in future terms (either
for your own classes or for your department), you will likely want to:

* Rename all channels to indicate the class and term in which they were used, for
  example:
  * **#announcements** → **#FA21 - CS101 - announcements**
  * **#CS101 > Lecture 1: Course intro** → **#FA21 - CS101 > Lecture 1: Course
    intro**
* If you do *not* want students from future classes to see messages
  from the prior term (e.g., because you posted homework solutions),
  [make all the channels from the class private][make-private]. You’ll
  be able to find and reuse content yourself, and [invite course
  staff][subscribe-to-channel] to these private channels as needed.
* You may choose to [deactivate students’ Doer
  accounts][deactivate-user] when the class is over.
* [Unpin channels](/help/pin-a-channel) from the class from your
  personal view.

If you do not plan to reuse the Doer organization, you can instead:

* [Export the organization](/help/export-your-organization) or [generate a static
  HTML archive](https://github.com/doer/doer-archive) to archive the information.
* [Deactivate the organization](/help/deactivate-your-organization).
