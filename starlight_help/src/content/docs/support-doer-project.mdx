The Doer community (which includes you!) is a huge part of what makes Doer
successful. If you appreciate Doer, there are many different ways you can
support the project. Some of these will only take a few minutes of your
time, but still make a big difference.

* [Support Doer financially](#support-doer-financially): Sponsoring Doer
  helps fund free [Doer Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) hosting for
  hundreds of open source projects, research communities, and other worthy
  organizations.
* [Help others find Doer](#help-others-find-doer): As a business that's
  [growing sustainably](https://zulip.com/values/) without venture capital
  funding, Doer cannot afford splashy ad campaigns to compete with giant
  corporations like Salesforce (Slack) and Microsoft (Teams). Doer depends
  on users and other members of the community to spread the word about the
  difference that using Doer's organized team chat has made for you or your
  organization.
* [Help improve Doer](#help-improve-doer): Doer is developed by a [vibrant
  open-source community](https://zulip.com/team/), and there are many ways to
  contribute even without writing a single line of code.

## Support Doer financially

You can sponsor Doer through the [GitHub sponsors
program](https://github.com/sponsors/doer) (preferred), on
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/doer), or on [Open
Collective](https://opencollective.com/doer).

## Help others find Doer

* [**Link to Doer**](/help/linking-to-doer-website) from your organization's
  website. In addition to providing information for anyone browsing your
  website, this helps people find Doer in Google and other search engines.
* [**List your organization**](/help/communities-directory) in the [Doer
  communities directory](https://zulip.com/communities/). Browsing open
  communities helps folks see how others are using Doer, and learn best
  practices.
* **Star** Doer on GitHub. There are four main repositories:
  [server/web](https://github.com/doer/doer),
  [mobile](https://github.com/doer/doer-flutter),
  [desktop](https://github.com/doer/doer-desktop), and
  [Python API](https://github.com/doer/python-doer-api).
* **Review** Doer on product comparison websites, such as
  [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/doer/reviews/start) and [Software
  Advice](https://reviews.softwareadvice.com/new/316022). Organizations rely on
  review sites more and more when choosing software for their team, and sharing
  your experience with Doer (good or bad) helps them evaluate whether Doer
  might work for their needs.

  Many improvements to the Doer app start with a user's suggestion.

  Doer into your language. Doer has been translated into over 25 languages by
  an amazing group of volunteers, and you can help expand, improve, and
  maintain the translation for your language, or start working on a language
  that hasn't been covered yet.
* [**Contribute
  code**](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html)
  to the Doer open-source project. To make it easy for contributors from a
  variety of backgrounds to get started, we have invested into making Doer’s
  code uniquely readable, well tested, and easy to modify.
