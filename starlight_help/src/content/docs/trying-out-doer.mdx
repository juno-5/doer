You can start by reading about how [Doer’s](https://zulip.com/)
unique topic-based threading [combines the best of email and
chat](https://zulip.com/why-doer/) to make [remote
work](https://zulip.com/for/business/) productive and delightful.

It's also easy to try out Doer for yourself.

<Steps>
  1. **Check out the Doer app**:
     * [View the Doer development community](https://chat.zulip.org/?show_try_doer_modal),
       where hundreds of participants collaborate to improve Doer. Many parts of
       the community are open for [public access](/help/public-access-option), so
       you can start exploring without creating an account.
     * [Create a demo organization](https://zulip.com/new/demo/) — no email required
       when you register. It only takes a minute, and is a great way to explore Doer
       even if you plan to [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/).
     * [See how Doer is being used](https://zulip.com/communities/) in open
       organizations that have opted in to be listed in the [Doer communities
       directory](/help/communities-directory).
  1. [Invite your teammates](/help/invite-users-to-join) to explore Doer with you.
     They will have a variety of perspectives on what's important in a chat app.
  1. **Run a week-long Doer trial** with your team, without using any other chat tools. This
     is the only way to truly experience how a new chat app will help your team
     communicate. You may want to:
     * [Convert your demo
       organization](/help/demo-organizations#convert-a-demo-organization-to-a-permanent-organization)
       to a permanent one, or [create a new
       organization](/help/create-an-organization#create-a-regular-organization).
     * Customize [organization settings](/help/customize-organization-settings)
       and [settings for new users](/help/customize-settings-for-new-users), but
       plan to adjust the details as you go.
     * [Create](/help/create-channels) your initial
       [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels), including a dedicated channel for
       questions and feedback about using Doer.
     * Educate others about how to use Doer's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics),
       and how to [move](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) any messages that
       belong elsewhere.
     * Set up [integrations](/help/integrations-overview) so that your team can
       experience all their regular workflows inside the Doer app.
