<Steps>
  1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Doer
     server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You
     can self-host Doer directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
     [Docker](https://github.com/doer/docker-doer), or with prebuilt images for
     [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/doer) and
     [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-doer).
  1. Create a Doer organization [on Doer Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or
     [on your self-hosted
     server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-3-create-a-doer-organization-and-log-in).
     You can create a new Doer Cloud organization in less than two minutes.
     Setting up a self-hosted server will take a bit longer, but is easy to
     do with Doer's [robust
     installer](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).
