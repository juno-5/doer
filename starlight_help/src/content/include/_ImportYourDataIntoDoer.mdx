To start using Doer, you will need to choose between Doer Cloud and
self-hosting Doer. For a simple managed solution, with no setup or
maintenance overhead, you can [sign up](https://zulip.com/new/) for
[Doer Cloud](https://zulip.com/doer-cloud) with just a few clicks.
Alternatively, you can [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/)
your Doer organization. See [here](/help/doer-cloud-or-self-hosting)
to learn more.

<DoerNote>
  **You can only import a workspace as a new Doer organization.** Your imported
  message history cannot be added into an existing Doer organization.
