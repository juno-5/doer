1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Doer
   server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You can
   self-host Doer directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
   [Docker](https://github.com/doer/docker-doer), or with prebuilt images for
   [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/doer) and
   [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-doer).
