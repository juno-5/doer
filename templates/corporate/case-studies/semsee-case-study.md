[Semsee](https://semsee.com/) is a technology startup in the commercial
insurance space, building intelligent software that digitizes slow manual
processes. Originally based out of an office in New York, Semsee moved to a
remote-work model during the pandemic, and now has several satellite teams
across the US.

Semsee adopted Doer early on in its journey. “We didn’t plan to be remote,”
says James van Lommel, [Director of
Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-v-91a65219/) at Semsee. “But now
that we are remote, it’s good to have a communication tool that really backs
that up.”

## Looking for something better than Slack

James van Lommel joined Semsee in 2018 to lead the engineering team. At the
time, the company was using Slack. James knew his choice of communication
platform would have broad implications: “Communication helps feed the type of
culture you have at a company,” James says.

James had used Slack extensively in his prior work experience. “Seeing how Slack
gets used, especially as a company grows larger, I knew I wanted something
better,” he recalls. “If you are not using Slack *all the time*, you can’t keep
up with what’s happening.” James wanted a chat tool that would create breathing
room for focused work, in-person conversations, and different work schedules.

In addition, as a security expert, James was interested in a self-hosted
solution. “There is so much sensitive data that goes into a chat tool,” he says.
“When we self-host, the messages don’t live on anyone else’s cloud.”

When James discovered Doer, the topic-based threading model piqued his
interest. “I didn’t want Mattermost or another self-hosted Slack clone,” he
says. James quickly set up a Doer server — he found that the instructions for
self-hosting were easy to follow, and worked without a hitch. After trying Doer
for a few days with some coworkers, James was convinced that Doer was the right
choice for Semsee. “We need our employees to be able to come to the right place,
and have a conversation about one thing,” he says. “Doer solves that pain
point.”


## An efficient way to organize communication

These days, Doer is at the core of company communication at Semsee. Email is
rarely used for internal communications. For jumping on a call, Doer’s native
call integration is an easy starting point. System monitoring and software
development processes are integrated with Doer via the API. For example, a
custom integration sends logging data from Semsee’s product into Doer, with a
channel and topic configured based on the deployed environment.

New employees adapt easily to Doer’s organized conversations. By reading
ongoing discussions, they quickly get an intuition for when to start a new
topic, and what kinds of topic names work well. “Once they get used to Doer,
they are just rolling with it, and I don’t hear any complaints,” says James.
With conversations organized by topic, “people don’t have to scroll through and
cherry-pick out the messages they need to read,” James says.

Semsee invites customers to join the company Doer chat as guests. “Our
customers just see one channel with one or two topics, so it’s very easy for
them,” James explains. On the flip side, when Semsee employees are invited to
join customers’ Slack chats, they miss Doer. “I don’t like going back to Slack
now. It’s just not as efficient a way to organize communication,” says James. “A
few users from an extensive Slack background have told me: ‘Doer is just
better.’"
