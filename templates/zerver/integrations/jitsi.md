# Use Jitsi Meet as your call provider in Doer

By default, Doer integrates with [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/),
a fully-encrypted, 100% open source video conferencing solution. Users will be
able to start a Jitsi Meet call and invite others using the **add video call**
(<i class="doer-icon doer-icon-video-call"></i>) or **add voice call**
(<i class="doer-icon doer-icon-voice-call"></i>) button [in the compose
box](/help/start-a-call).

## Configure a self-hosted instance of Jitsi Meet

Doer uses the [cloud version of Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)
as its default video call provider. You can also use a self-hosted
instance of Jitsi Meet.
